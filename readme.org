* CL-Bible
A script written in common lisp for accessing information about the KJV bible.

My intention was to create a tool for me to study bible verses and to practice Common Lisp with more focus on the later.

So far what you can do with is limited, but if you're intersted to see what the intended v1 will look like then read the TODO section.

** Run
#+begin_src lisp
  CL-USER> (download-bible-data) ;#> Downloads bible data
           (update-books-list) ;#> Updates the list of books
#+end_src

** Dependencies
- _[[https://github.com/eudoxia0/trivial-download][trivial-download]]_

** _Todo_
- Print verses in REPL properly with navigation
- Search passages
- Get information from verses based on seperate file
- Gather all quotes from people
